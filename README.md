*“Who could be so lucky? Who comes to a lake for water and sees the reflection of moon.”*

### Building artifacts for time to devour.

I wonder what will persist, what will adapt, what will decay and what will vanish.

What systems we fully parameterize will be considered hardcoded, and when?

### It's not what it is, it's what you identify.

All we are looking at, is a mass of uniform semantic atoms.

All we objectify, is a specific mass subset/transformation pattern we identify.

What we identify is what we practically utilize... Hence, we *pragmatize*.

### I love me some artsy stuff though...

That's how I got into coding: I just had to make surreal games.

Education extended this goal to a whole universe of interactive, simulative and intelligent artifacts.

Turns out, it's easy to become a servant to your toolset.

And industrial programming is not an artistic endeavor.

Regardless, I haven't deviated from the path of *Truth* yet... Or so I would like to believe.

### When I hit the software bucket, I want this stuff to be spilled on the floor.
